### CProject Description ###
The app is targeted towards music lovers who listen to too many artists to keep track of. We were unable to find a unified app that both tracks and notifies the user about albums and concerts. We want to fill this void. We plan to make an app that allows users to search and choose artists or bands to track. The application will keep track of upcoming albums and concerts and be presented in an organized and user friendly manner. There will be multiple tabs - one for looking at your specific saved artists, another to track all albums by date, and another to track all concerts relating to the saved artists by date.
